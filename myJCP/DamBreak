\subsection{Dam Break}
Here we test the CLSAdvection on the 2D dam break problem. This part we compare the CFD simulation results with the experiments made by Hu and Kashiwagi \cite{â€¢} for validation. The water tank with a removable partition is showed in figure \ref{}. 
The figure \ref{} shows the simulation results using the MULES, isoAdvector and CLSADvection methods and the experiment pictures.
