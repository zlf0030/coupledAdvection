\subsection{Droplet}
Here we test the CLSAdvection on the 2D droplet distortion problem. This part we compare the CFD simulation results with the CFD results made by Hu and Kashiwagi \cite{â€¢} for validation.
The figure \ref{} shows the simulation results using the MULES, isoAdvector and CLSADvection methods and the experiment pictures.
