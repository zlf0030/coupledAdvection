\begin{abstract}
%%%
A concise and factual abstract is required. The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, References should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.

\section{The Journal of Computational Physics}
\subsection{Scope}
The Journal of Computational Physics focuses on the computational aspects of physical problems. The scope of the Journal is the presentation of new or significantly improved techniques for the numerical solution of problems in all areas of physics. This is typically accomplished through advanced mathematical and numerical modeling reflecting a combination of concepts, methods and principles that are often interdisciplinary in nature and span several areas of physics, mechanics, mathematics, statistics, applied geometry, computer science and other scientific disciplines as well: the Journal seeks to emphasize methods that cross disciplinary boundaries.


 \subsection{Length}
 	Full text articles have a page limit of 35 pages. The Journal of Computational Physics also publishes short notes of 4 pages or less (including figures, tables, and references but excluding title pages). Letters to the Editor commenting on articles already published in this Journal will also be considered. Neither notes nor letters should have an abstract. Review articles providing a survey of particular fields are particularly encouraged. Published conference papers are welcome provided the submitted manuscript is a significant enhancement of the conference paper with substantial additions. Please use this template to estimate the page limit.
 	
\subsection{Reproducibility} 	
 Reproducibility, that is the ability to reproduce results obtained by others, is a core principle of the scientific method. As the impact of and knowledge discovery enabled by computational science and engineering continues to increase, it is imperative that reproducibility becomes a natural part of these activities. The journal strongly encourages authors to make available all software or data that would allow published results to be reproduced and that every effort is made to include sufficient information in manuscripts to enable this. This should not only include information used for setup but also details on post-processing to recover published results.



\section{Typesetting your paper}
\label{sec1}
Please use \verb+elsarticle.cls+ for typesetting your paper.
Additionally load the package \verb+jcomp.sty+ in the preamble using the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \usepackage{jcomp}
\end{verbatim}

Following commands are defined for this journal which are not in
\verb+elsarticle.cls+.
\begin{verbatim}
  \received{}
  \finalform{}
  \accepted{}
  \availableonline{}
  \communicated{}
\end{verbatim}

Any instructions relevant to the \verb+elsarticle.cls+ are applicable
here as well. See the online instruction available on:
\makeatletter
\if@twocolumn
\begin{verbatim}
 http://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/
 index.php?title=Elsarticle.cls
\end{verbatim}
\else
\begin{verbatim}
 http://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Elsarticle.cls
\end{verbatim}
\fi


\section{The first page}
Avoid using abbreviations in the title. Next, list all authors with
their first names or initials and surnames (in that order). Indicate
the author for correspondence (see elsarticle documentation).

Present addresses can be inserted as footnotes. After having listed all
authors' names, you should list their respective affiliations. Link
authors and affiliations using superscript lower case letters.



\section{The main text}

Please divide your article into (numbered) sections (You can find the
information about the sections at
\url{http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505619/authorinstructions}).
Ensure that all tables, figures and schemes are cited in the text in
numerical order. Trade names should have an initial capital letter, and
trademark protection should be acknowledged in the standard fashion,
using the superscripted characters for trademarks and registered
trademarks respectively. All measurements and data should be given in
SI units where possible, or other internationally accepted units.
Abbreviations should be used consistently throughout the text, and all
nonstandard abbreviations should be defined on first usage
\citep{Vehlowetal2013}.

\subsection{Tables, figures and schemes}
Graphics and tables may be positioned as they should appear in the
final manuscript. Figures, Schemes, and Tables should be numbered.
Structures in schemes should also be numbered consecutively, for ease
of discussion and reference in the text. \textcolor{newcolor}{\bf
Figures should be maximum half a page size.}

Depending on the
amount of detail, you can choose to display artwork in one column (20
pica wide) or across the page (42 pica wide). Scale your artwork in
your graphics program before incorporating it in your text. If the
artwork turns out to be too large or too small, resize it again in your
graphics program and re-import it. The text should not run along the
sides of any figure. This is an example for citation \citep{NewmanGirvan2004}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{jcompfig01}
\caption{Studio setup for capturing face images indoor. Three light
sources L1, L2, L3 were used in conjunction with normal office lights.}
\end{figure}

You might find positioning your artwork within the text difficult
anyway. In that case you may choose to place all artwork at the end of
the text and insert a marker in the text at the desired place. In any
case, please keep in mind that the placement of artwork may vary
somewhat in relation to the page lay-out \citep{HullermeierRifqi2009}.

This can easily be achieved using \verb+endfloat.sty+ package. Please
refer the following documentation to use this package.
\makeatletter
\if@twocolumn
\begin{verbatim}
  http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/
  endfloat/endfloat.pdf
\end{verbatim}
\else
\begin{verbatim}
  http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/endfloat.pdf
\end{verbatim}
\fi
\makeatother

\textcolor{newcolor}{\bf You should insert a caption for the figures
below the figures and for the tables the caption should be above the
tables.}

Please remember that we will always also need highresolution versions
of your artwork for printing, submitted as separate files in standard
format (i.e. TIFF or EPS), not included in the text document. Before
preparing your artwork, please take a look at our Web page:
\url{http://www.elsevier.com/locate/authorartwork}.


\subsection{Lists}

For tabular summations that do not deserve to be presented as
a table, lists are often used. Lists may be either numbered or
bulleted. Below you see examples of both.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first entry in this list
\item The second entry
\begin{enumerate}
\item A subentry
\end{enumerate}
\item The last entry
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item A bulleted list item
\item Another one
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Conventionally, in mathematical equations, variables and
anything that represents a value appear in italics.
All equations should be numbered for easy referencing. The number
should appear at the right margin.
\begin{equation}
S_{\rm pg}'=\frac{S_{\rm pg}-\min(S_{\rm pG})}
 {\max(S_{\rm pG}-\min(S_{\rm pG})}
\end{equation}
In mathematical expressions in running text ``/'' should be used for
division (not a horizontal line).

\section*{Acknowledgments}
Acknowledgments should be inserted at the end of the paper, before the
references, not as a footnote to the title. Use the unnumbered
Acknowledgements Head style for the Acknowledgments heading.

\section*{References}

Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in
the reference list (and vice versa).

\section*{\itshape Reference style}

Text: All citations in the text should refer to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Single author: the author's name (without initials, unless there
is ambiguity) and the year of publication;
\item Two authors: both authors' names and the year of publication;
\item Three or more authors: first author's name followed by `et al.'
and the year of publication.
\end{enumerate}
Citations may be made directly (or parenthetically). Groups of
references should be listed first alphabetically, then chronologically.

%%Vancouver style references.
\bibliographystyle{model1-num-names}
\bibliography{refs}

\section*{Supplementary Material}

Supplementary material that may be helpful in the review process should
be prepared and provided as a separate electronic file. That file can
then be transformed into PDF format and submitted along with the
manuscript and graphic files to the appropriate editorial office.
