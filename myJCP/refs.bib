	reactors and process equipment. It is therefore important to understand
	the dynamics of bubble formation and to develop computational models
	for the accurate prediction of the bubble formation dynamics in different
	bubbling regimes. This work reports the numerical investigations
	of bubble formation on submerged orifices under constant inflow conditions.
	Numerical simulations of bubble formation at high gas flow rates,
	where the bubble formation is dominated by inertial forces, were
	carried out using the combined level set and volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF)
	method and the predictions were experimentally validated. Effects
	of gas flow rate and orifice diameter on the bubbling regimes and
	in particular, on the transition from period-1 to period-2 bubbling
	regime (with pairing or coalescence at the orifice) were investigated.
	Using the simulation data on the transition of bubble formation regimes,
	the bubble formation regime map constructed using Froude (Fr=UO2/gdO)
	and Bond (Bo=ρlgdO2/σ) numbers is presented.},

  year = {1995},
  volume = {155},
  pages = {215 - 251},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {As a consequence of severe light water reactor accidents with core
	melting, jets of melt are considered to flow into the remaining water
	in the lower plenum. The breakup of these jets above and in the water
	determines the further accident progression, especially the mixing
	of the molten core material with the water and thus the possibility
	of strong vapor explosions or the mode of contact of core material
	with the lower plenum structures. Stripping at the melt surface due
	to relative flow, supported by interface instabilities, is considered
	here as a major mechanism of the jet breakup. Based on this, correlations
	are analysed in comparison with experimental results. Results from
	the more detailed model Ikejet developed at the IKE yield strong
	differences between the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) description of the
	interface instabilities and the Jeffreys-Miles (JM) approach. Calculations
	for experiments with simulant materials under non-boiling as well
	as film boiling conditions support the latter description whereas
	much too strong breakup results with KH. Correspondingly, applications
	to corium jets yield much longer coherent jets with the JM approach.
	Comparisons with corium experiments at the Argonne National Laboratories
	(ANL) and with first FARO-LWR tests at the JRC Ispra also still suffer
	from experimental uncertainties.},

	[G. Russo, P. Smereka, A remark on computing distance functions,

	least-squares method to explicitly minimize the displacement of the
	zero level set within the reinitialization. The overdetermined problem,
	which is solved in the first formulation of the new reinitialization
	scheme, is reduced to a determined problem in another formulation

	minimizing the number of constraints imposed on the reinitialization

	the interface when the reinitialization equation is solved with a
	first-order upwind scheme and do not diminish the accuracy of high-order
	discretizations of the level set equation. The computational work
	required for all components of the localized level set method scales
	with O(N). Detailed analyses of numerical solutions obtained with
	different discretization schemes evidence the enhanced accuracy and
	the stability of the proposed method, which can be used for localized
	and global level set methods.},

	the surface as a zero level set of a continuous function that is
	usually a signed distance function. The level set method is one of
	the best methods for simulating multi-phase flow because it can easily
	handle fast topological changes, as well as splitting and merging
	of fluids. In this thesis, a standard level set method was implemented
	in C++, using the finite element method library deal.II, to simulate
	incompressible two-phase flow on some benchmark problems. The results
	show a significant change of mass in the simulations, something that
	should not be allowed to happen when simulating incompressible fluids.
	The mass changes mainly occur in the reinitialization phase, where
	the level set function is rebuilt to look more like a signed distance
	function. },

  abstract = {The conservative level set methodology for interface transport is
	modified to allow for localized level set re-initialization. This
	approach is suitable to applications in which there is a significant
	amount of spatial variability in level set transport. The steady-state
	solution of the modified re-initialization equation matches that
	of the original conservative level set provided an additional Eikonal
	equation is solved, which can be done efficiently through a fast
	marching method (FMM). Implemented within the context of the accurate
	conservative level set method (ACLS) (Desjardins et al., 2008, [6]),
	the FMM solution of this Eikonal equation comes at no additional
	cost. A metric for the appropriate amount of local re-initialization
	is proposed based on estimates of local flow deformation and numerical
	diffusion. The method is compared to standard global re-initialization
	for two test cases, yielding the expected results that minor differences
	are observed for Zalesakʼs disk, and improvements in both mass conservation
	and interface topology are seen for a drop deforming in a vortex.
	Finally, the method is applied to simulation of a viscously damped
	standing wave and a three-dimensional drop impacting on a shallow
	pool. Negligible differences are observed for the standing wave,
	as expected. For the last case, results suggest that spatially varying
	re-initialization provides a reduction in spurious interfacial corrugations,
	improvements in the prediction of radial growth of the splashing
	lamella, and a reduction in conservation errors, as well as a reduction
	in overall computational cost that comes from improved conditioning
	of the pressure Poisson equation due to the removal of spurious corrugations.},

	linear interface geometry approximation ensures that solutions generated
	retain second-order spatial accuracy. Second-order temporal accuracy
	is achieved by virtue of a multidimensional unsplit time integration
	scheme. We detail our geometrically based solution method, in which
	material volume fluxes are computed systematically with a set of
	simple geometric tasks. We then interrogate the method by testing
	its ability to track interfaces through large, controlled topology
	changes, whereby an initially simple interface configuration is subjected
	to vortical flows. Numerical results for these strenuous test problems
	provide evidence for the algorithm's improved solution quality and
	accuracy.},

	interface is modified to treat the contact angle condition at the
	gas–liquid–solid interline as well as the no-slip condition at the
	fluid–solid interface. The no-slip condition is imposed by introducing
	another level set for fluid–solid phases and an effective viscosity
	formulation. In the immersed solid region where the level set function
	for gas–liquid phases is not well defined, its zero level set is
	calculated so that the contact angle condition should be satisfied
	where the three phases meet. The numerical method is validated through
	computations of interfacial motion subject to Taylor instability,
	single-fluid flow past a circular cylinder, and bubbles adhering
	to a cylindrical solid. },

	Interfacial terms are accounted for by adding the appropriate sources
	as δ functions at the boundary separating the phases. The unsteady
	Navier–Stokes equations are solved by a conventional finite volume
	method on a fixed, structured grid and the interface, or front, is

	is done by following the motion of the front. The method has been
	implemented for fully three-dimensional flows, as well as for two-dimensional
	and axisymmetric ones. First, the method is described for the flow
	of two or more isothermal phases. The representation of the moving
	interface and its dynamic restructuring, as well as the transfer
	of information between the moving front and the fixed grid, are discussed.
	Applications and extensions of the method to homogeneous bubbly flows,

	and boiling are then presented.},

	set (VOSET) method on dynamically adaptive quadtree grids. The interface
	is reconstructed by the VOF–PLIC algorithm, the level set function
	is re-distanced by a geometric operation, and the quadtree method
	is used to refine the grids near the interface. A static droplet
	in equilibrium without gravity is numerically simulated, and the
	results show that the pressure jump across the droplet can be accurately
	calculated.},
