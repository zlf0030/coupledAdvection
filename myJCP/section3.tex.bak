\subsection{Cutting the cell with $\alpha$ and $\phi$}
In this case, the normal direction $\mathbf{n}$ of certain cell is given by level set function $\phi$ and the void fraction $\alpha$ is given by volume of fluid function. This section means to explain the algorithm of finding such a plane with normal direction $\mathbf{n}$ that can cut the cell into the right void fraction $\alpha$. The locations of cell center point $\mathbf{x_i}$ and $N$ cell vertexes $\mathbf{x_{i_1}},...,\mathbf{x_{i_N}}$ are needed. Then we can get $N$ vectors $\mathbf{d_1},...,\mathbf{d_N}$ from cell center to $N$ cell vertexes. The projections of center point to vertex on the normal direction can be calculated as
\begin{equation}\label{21}
D_i=\mathbf{d_i}\cdot\mathbf{n},\quad for\quad i=1,...,N.
\end{equation}
Let us suppose the objective plane contain one of the vertexes and we can have a series of plane to cut the cell into different fractions (figure \ref{fig:multiplane}). Due to the cell's polyhedral characteristic, a piecewise function about the center cell distance and void fraction is drew in figure \ref{fig:piecewise}. The objective plane with the given void fraction $\alpha_i$ must have a certain distance $D^*$ to the center point $\mathbf{x_i}$ such that $\tilde{\alpha}(D^*)=\alpha_i $ .The first step is to find the point on the certain part of the piecewise function, which can be realized by comparing the void fraction value of vertexes and $\alpha^*$. Suppose the point $p$ is between point $k$ and $l$, such that ${D^*}\in[D_k,D_l]$. We use a cubic polynomial to fit this interval. The second step is to find the two trisection point in this interval, say, $m$ and $n$, and calculate the $\tilde{\alpha}(D_m)$ and $\tilde{\alpha}(D_n)$ in geometric way. Then we have four points for the four polynomial coefficients by solving a group of linear equations. Use LU decomposition to solve the linear $4\times4$ Vandermonde matrix system. Then use Newton's root finding method to find $D^*$ with the condition, $\left|\tilde{\alpha}(D^*)-\alpha_i\right|<\epsilon$. $\epsilon$ is a user-defined tolerance, typically set to $10^{-8}$.
